**Internet Speed Complain tBot
**

**Overview**
InternetSpeedComplaintBot is an automated script written in Python using Selenium WebDriver. Its primary function is to check the internet speed using Speedtest.net and, if the speed is below a certain threshold, log into Twitter and post a complaint to your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

**Features**
•	Automated Speed Testing: The bot uses Speedtest.net to measure your internet download and upload speeds.
•	Twitter Integration: If the measured speeds are below the promised thresholds, the bot automatically logs into Twitter and tweets a complaint to your ISP.
•	Customizable Thresholds: Users can set their own promised download and upload speeds for comparison.
